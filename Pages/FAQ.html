                            <p>
                                Sometimes our furry friends pick up hitchhikers that make them very 
                                itchy and uncomfortable. If gone unchecked, fleas can infest your 
                                home, making it even more difficult to rid them from your loved 
                                one's coat. To eliminate fleas, choose a shampoo specially 
                                formulated to kill fleas and be sure to read and follow all 
                                instructions on the label. Repeat treatment as necessary until your 
                                pet is free of fleas; if you see skin irritation, stop use 
                                immediately and contact your local vet.

                            <h2>How long can I expect my pet bird to live?</h2>
                            <p>
                                The answer can vary widely depending on the type of bird, the size, 
                                the environment, and of course, mother nature. Assuming all is well 
                                in the external factors that are out of the owner's control, 
                                cockatiels and budgies live up to 20 years old on average. However, 
                                many parrot variations are known to live nearly an astounding 100 
                                years! As with many living organisms, longevity can be increased by 
                                keeping annual veterinarian visits, maintaining a healthy diet, and 
                                keeping your feathery friend's environment sanitary.

                            <h2>How often should I feed my pet snake?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Most snakes eat one to two times per week, depending on their age, 
                                size, and activity level. Female snakes often increase their food 
                                intake as breeding season gets underway. Some snakes can go as long 
                                as two weeks before needing their next meal; this is normal. 
                                However, if your snake has not eaten in two or three weeks and seems 
                                lethargic, reach out to your local vet to determine if your snake 
                                might be ill or injured.
